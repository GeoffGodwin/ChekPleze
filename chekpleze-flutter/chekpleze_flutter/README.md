# chekpleze_flutter

ChekPleze is a quick, easy to use check splitting app for when you're out to dinner with friends. When the bill arrives just add your guests, punch in the numbers from the bill, anc ChekPleze will let you drag and drop each dish to the guest!

## Getting Started

To run this application you'll need to have the Flutter SDK setup on your local machine. Once we have baked builds we'll upload an APK. The app will be built to support Android and iOS but there is no current plan for flutter web. 

If you're a collaborator and new to Flutter, here are a few resources to get you started:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
